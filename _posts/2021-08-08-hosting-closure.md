Due to the mass adoption of Discord, and it's capabilities, Lords of Peril Leadership have come to the conclusion that the time has now come to close down the forums and domain -- _http:/wwww.lordsofperil.org_.

Please join us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/cj9Qr9p6Zv) if you haven't already.

Of course, as always, you can find us in-game currently existing as **FFLOP\|GLADS**.
